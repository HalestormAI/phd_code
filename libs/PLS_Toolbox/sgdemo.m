% Once again, since we created the "true" signal, we have
% the opportunity to make some comparisons. The true signal
% was y = t*sin(t)/20, so the true derivative is 
% dy/dt = (sin(t) + t*cos(t))/20. The Savitsky-Golay routine
% assumes that the points are given at unit distances apart,
% and our sample was taken at increments of 0.1, so the
% calculated derivative must be divided by 10 to match the
% Savitsky-Golay estimate. We can compare this to
% our calculated derivative.
