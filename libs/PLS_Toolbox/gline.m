function gline(lc)
%GLINE adds a line to a plot with ends at locations specified by clicks
%  GLINE draws a line to an existing plot with ends 
%  at locations specified by mouse clicks. When run
%  the routine waits for 2 mouse clicks on a plot which
%  define the ends of the line to be drawn.
%  The optional input variable (lc) can be used to
%  define the line style and color as in normal plotting.
%  Example: gline('-r'); plots a solid red line after the
%  mouse has been clicked on a plot twice. If no input
%  arguments are given, gline will draw a green line.
