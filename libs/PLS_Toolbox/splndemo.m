% First we'll load some bivariate data and show how the stand alone
% spline functions work.  The function splnfit can be used
% to fit a spline with user specified degree and number
% of knots to a pair of vectors.  There is no limit to the number
% of knots and spline polynomial degree, however,
% numerical instabilities will occur for very high orders
% or large numbers of knots in some cases.
