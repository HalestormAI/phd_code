%UNFOLDR unfolds a matrix to a vector for MPCA.
%  UNFOLDR unfolds the input matrix (xmat) to a row vector
%  (xvec) for MPCA. Each column of (xmat) is transposed and
%  augmented to create a vector (xvec). Example: For an
%  M by N input matrix A each M by 1 column ai is transposed
%  and augmented such that [xvec] = [a1',a2',...,aN'].

%I/O: [xvec] = unfoldr(xmat);
