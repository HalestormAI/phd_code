% First lets create some input/output data from a process.  Imagine that
% we are trying to determine the lag time of vibrations through a
% structure.  We'll use a random signal vibrational input u at one
% point in the structure and we'll listen somewhere else for the
% output y.  We can create the input signal u easily, and then we'll
% look at its autocorrelation function.
