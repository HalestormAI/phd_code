% If anything, this looks worse, so lets try out the pca modelling.
% I'm going to need your help once the 'pca' function starts.
% You will have to chose the number of principal components

% results from this data. We'll generate them using the crossval
% function. Hit a key when you are ready.

% We now have a PCA model with as many PCs as you chose.  We might
% also want to look at some of the scores vectors plotted against
% each other.  We can do this using the 'pltscrs' function.
% Try ploting the first vs. second PCs and some other combinations.
% You can also do 3-D plots using 3 of the PCs. The routine 
% will plot them with the sample number if you want, but it is 
% pretty messy!

% These plots really aren't all that interesting, but I wanted you
% to know how to make scores plots.  We can also plot pairs of
% loadings (or triples) against each other using 'pltloads'.
% The 'pltloads' function can also utilize a "vector" of
% labels for the variables.  We can input these variable names
% by creating a new variable where each "row" is one of the
% variable names.  Note that all variables must have the same
% number of letters!

% limits calculated for part1 after about the first 100 samples.
% The residual is also much larger and the T^2 value is too.
