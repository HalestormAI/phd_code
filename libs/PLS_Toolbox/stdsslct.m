function [specsub,specnos] = stdsslct(spec,nosamps,rinv)
%STDSSLCT Selects subset of spectra for use in standardization
%  Selects a subset of the given spectra based on leverage for
%  use in developing transforms for instrument standardization.
%  The inputs are the available spectra (spec) and the number
%  samples to be selected (nosamps). The optional input (rinv)
%  is the model inverse used for the calibration model to be 
%  used with the data. If this is supplied, samples will be 
%  selected based on their leverage on the calibration model.
%  Otherwise, they will be selected based on their distance 
%  from the multivariate mean. The outputs are the matrix
%  of spectra selected (specsub) and the sample numbers of the
%  selected spectra (specnos).
