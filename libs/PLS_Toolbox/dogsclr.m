function [gys] = dogsclr(yin,vars,mxs,stdxs)
%DOGSCLR applies group scaling to submatrices of a matrix.
%  DOGSCLR group scales submatrices of a data matrix (yin).
%  Inputs are the number of variables (vars), a rowvector 
%  of means (mxs), and a row vector of standard deviations
%  (stdxs) that are output by the DOGSCL function. The output
%  is a group scaled matrix (gys). A typical application
%  is to scale a matrix unfolded for MPCA.
%
%I/O:  [gys] = dogsclr(yin,vars,mxs,stdxs);
