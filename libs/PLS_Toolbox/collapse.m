function [W12,W23,B2,B3]=collapse(NEURAL,W,Q,P,fac)
%COLLAPSE Calculates final neural net model from NNPLS
%  The inputs are parameters in the neural network inner model, (NEURAL),
%  the PLS X-block weights (W), Y-block weights (Q), X-block loadings
%  (P) and the number of factors to be used (fac). The outputs are the
%  weights to the hidden nodes (W12), weights to the output nodes (W23),
%  biases on the hidden nodes (B2) and biases on the output nodes (B3).
