% spectra to evolve with time as the constituents react. Some
% chemical species disappear as they are consumed and others

% observed spectra with time.

% The plot shows NIR spectra taken at 11 different time points as
% the reaction has proceeded. How many species are present in the
% reactor as the reaction proceeds? It's pretty difficult to tell
% just by examining the plot.

% Evolving factor analysis can be used to get information about how
% many independent factors are in the data set at each time step.
% Let's run EVOLVFA and examine it's output. The input variable
% is 'obspec'. The second input ensures that the results are
% plotted and the third, 'tdat', is time data to plot results against.

% The first step in the forward analysis calculates the eigen
% value of the first measured spectra. Then eigen values are
% calculated of matrices as new measured spectra are appended.

% The forward analysis suggests that 3 independent factors have
% "evolved into" the data set. One factor appears at the onset,
% a second factor rises out of the background noise at time 0.2,
% and a third factor appears at time 0.6.

pause

% Now let's examine results of the reverse analysis. The reverse
% analysis is similar to the forward analysis except that eigen
% values are calculated for the last spectra first, and subsequent
% eigen values are calculated as spectra are appended in a 
% reverse fashion.

% The reverse analysis gives results of when factors
% "evolved out of" the data set, or when factors disappeared 
% from the data set. The results suggest that there is one
% factor remaining at the end of the process, a second factor
% disappeared at time 0.9, and a third factor disappears at
% time 0.7.

pause

% The times for factors appearing and disappearing identified 
% in the evolving factor analysis give hints about when different
% chemical species are present in the process. This is helpful
% when that information is not available at the onset. However, 
% In this example the 'measured' spectra were created from known
% concentrations. Let's plot the original concentration profiles
% and compare our results.

% For this example there are three contituents. The first is
% present at the onset of the reaction decreases and disappears 
% at about time 0.7. A second constituent first appears at time 0.2 
% reaches a maximum and disappears at time 0.9. A third constituent 
% first appears at time 0.6 and persisted to the end of the reaction.

% Results from the evolving factor analysis clearly identified the
% existence of three independent factors. These results can also be
% used to estimate the window of existence for each reactant. If we
% assume that the first reactant to appear was also the first to leave
% we can get a pretty good estimate of the time window of existence 
% for the first reactant. Good estimates for the other two constituents
% could also be gotten under this assumption. A word of caution is
% appropriate. The assumption that first to appear is the first to
% disappear can not always be made. In addition, evolving factor
% analysis identifies independent factors not constituents. Reactants
% that co-vary would not be split out as a separate factor.
