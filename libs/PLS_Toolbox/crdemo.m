% Yes that's right, the level correlates with temperature.  Now
% lets use that fact to build a PLS model that uses temperature
% to predict level.  Lets start by mean centering the data.

% Now that the data is scaled we can use the POWERPLS routine 
% to develop a calibration. We'll also make some models using 
% PCR, PLS and MLR and compare them to the CR models.
% We will cross validate over the region of powers of 1/2 to
% 1/8. (From previous tests, I've observed that the best models
% for this problem lie in this range.) Because this is time
% series data, we will use block cross validation, i.e. 
% contiguous blocks of data will be used as test sets.
% We will start by calculating the CR models, using a maximum
% of 5 latent variables. While we're at it, we'll also determine
% the cross validation error on an MLR model.

% Just in case that PRESS surface when by too fast, you

% the fit error declines as you go towards more LVs or towards
% the MLR side of the continuum. You can use the buttons in
% the upper right hand corner of the plot to get different
