function [newu,newy] = wrtpulse(u,y,n,delay);
%WRTPULSE Creates input/output matrices for dynamic model identification
%  This function rewrites vectors of system inputs and output
%  so that they may be used with the PLS and other modelling
%  routines to obtain finite impulse response and ARX models.
%  The inputs are the input vector or matrix of input vectors (u),
%  (where the each input is a column vector), the process output
%  vector (y), a scalar or vector of number of past periods to
%  consider for each input (n), and a scalar or vector of delays 
%  corresponding to each input (delay). The output of the 
%  function is a matrix of lagged input variables (newu) and 
%  corresponding output vector (newy).
