function [u2,y2] = writein2(u,y,n);
%WRITEIN2 Writes input and output matrices for dynamic model identificaton
%  This function writes files from process input and output vectors
%  that are the diagonal shifted type so that process models can
%  be obtained using PLS and other modelling methods. The
%  inputs are the original process input vector (u), the process
%  output vector (y), and the number of past inputs to consider (n).
%  The output of the function is the matrix of input sequences
%  (u2) and corresponding output vector (y2).
%
%  Note: for multiple input systems or systems with delays,
%  please see WRTPULSE.
