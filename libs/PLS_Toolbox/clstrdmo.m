% This script demonstrates the PLS_Toolbox function CLUSTER
% for plotting dendrograms based on K-means or K-nearest
% neighbor (KNNN) clustering. It uses data from a 
% Linear Solvation Energy Relationship (LSER) model published 
% by Jay W. Grate. The data consists of the 6 LSER model 
% coefficients for 14 polymers.

% The function will prompt you to choose between K-means
% and K-nearest neibhbor, for scaling options and
% the option to use PCA scores with Mahalanobis distance
% measure. The dendrogram that will be plotted will show
% the distances between the samples (or their scores) and 
% between the means of the sample groups.  

% Let's load the data in and get going.

% Now that the data is loaded, we can use the CLUSTER function.  
% Note that we have also loaded in a vector containing the 
% names of the polymers.

% When the cluster function starts you will be presented with 
% several options. The first is whether you would like K-means
% or KNN. In K-means the distance between groups of samples is
% defined as the distance between the centroid (multivariate
% mean) of the group. In KNN, the distance between groups is
% defined as the distance between the two nearest neighbors
% of each group.

% The function will also prompt you for the data scaling desired, 
% if you want the distance to be based on PC scores 
% and whether you would like to use a Mahalanobis distance or 
% not.  For this application we like no scaling and no PCA, but 
% you can run it a few times and see what you like.

% As the function runs it displays how it is connecting the 
% samples together, although if you have a fast computer this 
% might go by sort of quick.
