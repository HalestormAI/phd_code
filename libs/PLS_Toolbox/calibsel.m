%  Note that the convention between the help file here and
%  the above reference are opposite i.e. x is the predictor
%  block and y is the predicted block here.
%  Please address any comments to the above address.
%  INPUTS:
%	x		Calibration spectral frequencies. This is a matrix
%			of size (n,p) where typically p is on the order 
%			of 10^3 and n is on the order of 10^1.  
%	y		Calibration input concentration. This is a matrix
%			of size (n,1).
%	So, we have that a measurement device such as a 
%	chemical spectrometer measures a concentration and
%	records the energy in many different spectral levels:
%
%			X(i,j) = MEASURE( Y(i) )
%
%	and we want to know which of the channels (which j's)
%	are most important in the calibration of the 
%	instrument (the return value, calibsel).
%
%   alpha	Significance level for the chi-square quantiles. Should
%			be for example, .10, .05, .01.
%	flag	flag = 1 says to use the matrix calculations to solve
%			for the estimates.  Use this if you have lots of 
%			memory and p is not too large. flag <> 1 says to loop
%			over the p values that you actually need.  Use this
%			if you have less memory or if p is large.
%
% OUTPUT:
%	channel	This is a vector of the indices of the x matrix that
%			are used in the estimation of the unknown 
%			concentrations.  The length of this interval is the 
%			value of q' described in the paper.  The vector of
%			indices corresponds to the channels (columns) of x
%			that should be used in the calibration.

% Get estimates of alpha, beta, and sigma^2.  Note that the method used

% calculation of y*y' in the ehat line creates a very large matrix that 
% might cause the computer to access virtual memory.  Even without 
% accessing virtual memory, the code might still run faster in that it 
% may be faster to loop over p values than it is to calculate p*p values 
% internally when p is very large.  Flag for looping is determined from 
% an input variable.
