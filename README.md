All the code used to generate figures in for my PhD research

Thesis entitled "Ground Plane Rectification from Crowd Motion" (2014) is available [from the White Rose Consortium website](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6865/).

The accompanying conference paper "Automated Ground-Plane Estimation for Trajectory Rectification" (2013) can be found [on ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272350152_Automated_Ground-Plane_Estimation_for_Trajectory_Rectification).

## Notes:
This code is OLD - hasn't been touched since 2014, and I won't be using it again.

There's a good chance a lot of it won't work with recent versions of Matlab - I haven't got access to one to try.

It's also not been tidied up or organised in any way shape or form.

Good luck!
